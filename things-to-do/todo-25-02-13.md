- DONE: CITI? follow up when kat connects us
- STARTED: finish one cs50 week 2 problem set (or at least meaningfully start)
- do something on GAP front end (just for a react refresh) OR deploy GAP backend
- reach out to andy about QT conference '25
- reach out to simon & partner re: webflow website to see if they still need help
