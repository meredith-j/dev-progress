- i learned a better way to test form validation & button functions (ie clicking submit button and handlesubmit function runs).
- reminder: when tests aren't working as they should be, take not of what props your react component takes in. should this be a UI test or should you refactor and move function to it's own file (to import into component)? if doing the latter, you can test function file and use the function's arguments in the way you would use a component's props
- reminder: an important function can be the value of a local variable (ie: let value = Function(arguments))
